SecureFaceAccess System Installation and Usage Guide

Overview

SecureFaceAccess is a facial recognition-based access control system that captures and recognizes faces in real-time. The system integrates with an Arduino Uno to control a door mechanism. When a recognized face is detected, the door opens, and a "Welcome" message is displayed.

Prerequisites

Hardware:
Computer with a webcam
Arduino Uno board
Door mechanism (e.g., servo motor)
Necessary cables to connect the Arduino Uno to the computer and the door mechanism
Software:
Python 3.x installed on your computer
Arduino IDE installed on your computer
Required Python packages (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the SecureFaceAccess repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureFaceAccess.git
cd SecureFaceAccess
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Upload Arduino Code
Open the Arduino IDE.
Load the arduino_code.ino file located in the SecureFaceAccess directory.
Select the correct board type and port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
4. Connect Hardware
Connect the hardware components as follows:

Connect the webcam to your computer.
Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB.
Connect the door mechanism (e.g., servo motor) to the specified digital pin on the Arduino Uno.
Usage

1. Run the Python Script
Run the main.py Python script to start the SecureFaceAccess system:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
2. Face Recognition
The webcam will capture frames and recognize faces in real-time.
When a recognized face is detected, the door will open, and a "Welcome" message will be displayed.
3. Capture Unknown Faces
If an unknown face is detected, the system will capture an image and assign a unique serial number to the person.
The door will still open for unknown faces, but their images will be saved in the images folder.
4. Close the System
Press 'q' on your keyboard to close the system. This will release the webcam and close the application.

Troubleshooting

Ensure that all hardware components are correctly connected.
Check the serial port in the Python script (main.py) and update it if necessary.
Adjust delays in the Arduino code (arduino_code.ino) and Python script as needed for your door mechanism.
Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and set up the SecureFaceAccess system. Feel free to customize and extend the system based on your requirements.
